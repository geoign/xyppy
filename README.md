----------------------------------------------------------
There are numerous tools for creating grid data from scattered topographical xyz points (e.g. xyz2grd in GMT).
However, they are usually designed for Megabytes of such data, which can be fit well within the memory.
xyppy allows to make a grid file from gigabytes or even terabytes of data. This is the main purpose of the development.
